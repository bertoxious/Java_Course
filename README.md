### Superfast java

## Key notes:

#### Abstract class ðŸ‘‡
Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the user. There are two ways to achieve abstraction: 
1. Abstract Class(0-100%)
2. Interface(100%)
eg. abstract class Laptop{ abstract void configurations(); }
class Hp extends Laptop{ void configurations(){System.out.println("Here are the specs.");} public static void main(String [] args){ Laptop h = new Hp(); h.configurations();}}
A java interface can only have abstract methods.
We cannot create object of an abstract class and an abstract method is the method which is declared without its implementation. eg abstract String Method();
#### Constructor Chaining ðŸ‘‡
In java everytime we create an object of class it calls the parent class constructor even if you don't specify. This is called constructor chaining.
#### Super ðŸ‘‡
we cannot use super keyword from a static method.
Use cases of super keyword : 1. Accessing parent class variables i.e. super.VARIABLE_NAME 2. Accessing parent class methods i.e. super.METHOD_NAME() 3. Accessing parent class constructor i.e. super(PARAMETERS)
#### Inheritance ðŸ‘‡
A super class can never access members of a subclass 
#### The 3P's ðŸ‘‡
private - not inherited
public - anyone can access i.e. also accessible outside package.
protected - allow access to package members only.
#### String Pool ðŸ‘‡
Strign pool is a storage area in Java Heap where string literals gets stored. By default it is empty and privately maintained by Java String Class.
Whenever we create a string the string occupies some space in heap memory. Creating a number of strings ay increase the cost and memory too which may reduce the performance also.
String Pool :: String a = "Python"; String b = "Data Science"; String c = "Python"; 
things stored in String Pool :: Python, Data Science
Java Heap :: String a = new String("Java");String b = new String("C++");String c = new String("Data Science"); 
stored in heap :: Java, C++, Data Science
this will be stored in String Pool :: String d = new String("Data Science").intern();
#### Constructors ðŸ‘‡
this must be the first statement inside constructor and there should be only one this statement per constructor.
If constructors are defined manually then no automatic constructor or no Args Constructor will be created.
Constructors cannot be private.
A constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, native, strictftp or synchronized.
Constructors do not return a value.
Constructors do not have a return type not even void.
#### Static ðŸ‘‡
Memory allocation is done only once for a static variable. Since memory is allocated for the static variables or functions, these can be called without using objects.
Static variables are stored in static memory. A static int variable remains in the memory while the program is running. A normal or auto variable is destroyed when a function stops. A static function can be invoked without the use of object.
A static function can't be overridden. A static variable can't be defined inside a method as it would generate a compile time error. A static variable is shared among all the instances of a class. It like a global variable available to all methods.
Static methods can be overloaded but cannot be overriden.
#### Loose Coupling ðŸ‘‡
Classes are independent of each other. The only knowledge one class has about the other class is what the other class has exposed through its interface.
#### Tight Coupling ðŸ‘‡
When two classes are highly dependent on each other it is called Tight Coupling.
#### Interfaces ðŸ‘‡
Interfaces are used for inheritance purposes only. Interfaces do not have any visibility section, as they do not need any. They have methods which need to be implemented in the sub class. In the subclasses we can inherit the methods of interfaces publicly or privately or in protected mode.
A class can only implement an interface and cannot extend an interface. 
An interface can extend multiple interfaces i.e public interface Interface1 extends Interface2, Interface3{}
Interfaces are non-instantiable. i.e we cannot create objects of interfaces as interfaces contain the abstract methods and these methods are used via implements keyword only.
#### Upcasting and Downcasting
### Parent p = new Child();
In this the child is implicitly typecasted to parent so we can invoke the only methods in the parent class.
### Child c = (Child) p;
In this we are downcasting explicitly and this would invoke both the parent and the child methods.
